## BioImage Informatics ##
The project is focused on developing a comprehensive set of MATLAB functions for bio-image analysis and processing. Following methods are explored in depth, with case studies, and more:
  * Color spaces, color space transformations,
  * Spatial filtering: point, line and edge detectors,
  * Frequency filtering: lowpass filters, highpass and other filters,
  * Mathematical morphology,
  * Image segmentation: thresholding, region growing, region splitting and merging,
  * Image analysis: texture analysis, features extraction.
Implemented methods are described in the [Wiki](Home.md) section.

  * _Research_:  My interdisciplinary research focuses on advancing the state of the art in development and application of new image analysis and processing technologies aimed at a better understanding of the complex biological processes which occur at the cellular and sub-cellular level. My work includes analyzing, processing and understanding the biological images obtained by confocal, scanning laser, atomic force, differential interface contrast, optical and polarized microscopy.
